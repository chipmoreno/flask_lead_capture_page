Okay, if you have a bit of technical know-how - you can deploy a lead capture page for free with this repository. You'll need Visual Studio code.

1. Create a venv.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Intall Google Cloud CLI. Within Google Cloud, you need to set api_key as your Brevo API key ON GOOGLE CLOUD, not locally. You can set it locally if you want to test the application locally, but for deploying, you'll need to set it within Google Cloud.
4. Attempt to deploy - check logs in Google Cloud Run for errors.

I have it intregated with Brevo's API to capture the emails. Just create an account on Brevo.
